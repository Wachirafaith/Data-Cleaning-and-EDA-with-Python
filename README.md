# Data Analysis Projects - **Python**

This repository contains two python projects focused on practical data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas. The goal is to demonstrate essential data preprocessing and analysis skills for real world datasets.


## 1. Data Cleaning in Pandas – **Customer Call List Dataset**

In this project, I used a dataset of customer call records to practice and demonstrate data cleaning techniques using pandas.

### Tasks Performed:
- Removed duplicates  
- Dropped irrelevant columns  
- Standardizing column by column 
- Handled missing values (removed or filled where necessary)  

This project highlights how to prepare a messy dataset for further analysis or modeling.


## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis – **World Population Dataset**

The second project focuses on exploring a dataset on world population to offer insights into global population trends.

### Tasks Performed:
- Imported and explored the dataset using pandas  
- Summarized data using `.describe()` and `.info()`  
- Visualized trends and distributions (population, growth, etc.)  
- Grouped and sorted countries based on key metrics  
- Handled missing data and formatted values appropriately


## Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
